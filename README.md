# Body Slam
This is my take on a Snorlax abilities app that can list Snorlax's abilities.
## Features
- Home page listing Snorlax's possible moves/abilities
- Each ability page will give a breakdown of damage, power points and potential damage
- The individual ability page also will displayed in the move type's colour scheme
- Individual ability pages also displays an image or gif of Snorlax using that move, otherwise it will show a default image of snorlax

## Tech

In this task I used a mix of technologies I was familiar with. This was my first time using Next.js in a project and I quickly saw its advantages.

- [React] - The library for web and native user interfaces
- [Next.js] - The React Framework for the Web
- [node.js] - free, open-source, cross-platform environment that lets developers create servers, web apps, command line tools and scripts
- [Tailwind CSS] - build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML

## Installation

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
```

Open [localhost:3000]

## Testing

Unfortunately I was not able to write any tests, but I would have gone with [Vitest].

Tests I would have liked to write would be:
- Checking if the home screen was loading the abilities correctly
- Calculating damage potential with missing damage or pp
- Trying to access a non-existent move
- Loading ability page when there is no image of Snorlax provided
- Checking if the colours for the ability type is loading correctly or if the type doesn't exist

## Wrap Up
I this app were to be scaled up to include all Pokemon and abilities this is how I would approach the task.

- Start using the Pokemon API to get relevant Pokemon and abilities information
    - Pokemon API is pretty slow so will need to use Pagination when loading Pokemon
    - Rate limiting has been removed by the Pokemon API so we donâ€™t need to worry that our users will crash it
    - Non-MVP task but having a search bar to find Pokemon will be very useful considering there are 1025 Pokemon
- Images of the Pokemon using all the abilities likely won't make it to the MVP
    - There are 1025 Pokemon and 934 abilities, which is too much for an MVP
    - Will likely end up being a separate project to get all of the images and deploy it as a rolling update
- Probably will forego making a separate individual ability page since the images won't be included anyway
    - The new individual Pokemon page will include damage potential in the table
    - Maybe the type text can be formatted to the associate type colour
- Host the website using AWS services so we can scale up or down depending on the amount of users that use the app

### Stories and Timeboxing
1. Home page with all the Pokemon
    - Front end: make home page - 2 days with testing
    - Back end: create API calls using the Pokemon API to return a list of all Pokemon - 1 day with testing
2. Clicking a Pokemon to send them an individual Pokemon page listing their moves and information
    - Front end: make a dynamic individual Pokemon page - 1 day with testing
    - Back end: create API call to get individual Pokemon details - 1 day with testing
    - Back end: create API call to get ability details - 1 day with testing

Total time allocation : 6 days
